Analysis scripts for Hawco et al., "Cognitive-Behavioral Predictors of Individual Variability of Functional Connectivity in Healthy Young Adults: Itâ€™s better to be average."

Data from the Human Conenctome Proejct was downlaoded from https://db.humanconnectome.org/. Data msut be acessed with eprmission, and cannot be re-shared here. 

THe script hcp_Variability_final.m contains the core of the code and is annotated to help, but the user would ned to reconstruct the HCP data matricies and variables, which requires restricted acces to do. Hoppefully the annotations are enough to help. 

hcp.R is an R script which runs the heirarchical regressions, written by Julia Gallucci. I provided variables as a csv file. 

Any questions can be direcred at colin.hawco@camh.ca
